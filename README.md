# Halo Shaders
Shaders for Halo assets imported into unity

I made these primarily for maps and avatars for vrchat.

# Notes:

The armor detail shaders need a detail texture (which should be tiled) in order to look right.
If there is no splatmap for a specific texture set, use a plain black texture.
Armor seems to look best with the smoothness slider between 0.75 and 1
